OAuth2Stack
===========

A client side starter kit that demos authenticating from an OAuth2 provider (like the one this example is being built for)

Some quick notes

- Bootstrap / Ember used for this example but Angular, WPF, and other implementations.  Just needed to start somewhere.

- Issues will be used to track changes and introduce large 

- Project structure will change as we introduce new features or project restruct/refactoring
